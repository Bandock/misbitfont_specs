# MisbitFont Specifications

MisbitFont is a bitmap font format standard designed to be both platform agnostic and encoding agnostic.
Useful applications for this format include games, emulators, fantasy/virtual computers and consoles, and
others.  This is not meant to replace vector fonts.  Also not meant to replace image formats (in fact, you
can very well convert to those formats).
